schema.rs 

The Logic: This file allows us to be Dynamic. 
If you change the JSON, this code automatically changes how the rest of the engine behaves without you recompiling.

mmap_store.rs
The Logic: Instead of "loading" a 1GB file into RAM (which is slow), mmap just points the CPU to the file on disk. 
The data only moves when you actually touch it.

column.rs
The Logic: This solves your "Is it an Int?" switching problem.
 We decide the type here, then hand the whole "Vault" to the next step.

functions.rs
The Logic: bytemuck makes the "cast" instant. par_iter makes the loop multi-threaded. 
The if let happens outside the loop, so the CPU never gets interrupted.

main.rs
This is the Coordinator. It connects all the pieces.
Ask Catalog for the schema.
Ask Storage to open the files based on that schema.
Ask Compute to "Screen" the Dept column (creates a BitMask).
Ask Compute to "Crunch" the Salary column (uses the BitMask).
Print the result.

Command to Run
Use this command to query for Department 1, employees older than 30, earning more than $50,000:

cargo run --release -- 1 30 50000
